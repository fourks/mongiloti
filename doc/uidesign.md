### Mongiloti UI Design

We have limited knobs in 3 sections to control multiple objects

* 3x OSC
* 4x ENV
* 3x Filter

We have multiple OSC's, ENV's, LFO's and Filters objects. Each of these have
multiple parameters. The proposed UI design is to use the Encoder to "cycle"
through the object types and dynamically change the knob functions to control
parameters of the selected object.*

**Objects**

| Object | Section  | Param1 | Param2 | Param3 | Param4 |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| OSC1   | OSC      |Pitch   |        |        |        |
| OSC2   | OSC      |        |        |        |        |
| ENV1   | Env      |        |        |        |        |
| ENV2   | Env      |        |        |        |        |
| LFO1   | Filters? |        |        |        |        |
| LFO2   | Filters? |        |        |        |        |
| Filter | Filter   |        |        |        |        |
| FX1    | ?        |        |        |        |        |
| FX2    | ?        |        |        |        |        |
